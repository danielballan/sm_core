SM core
=======

A proposed referance implementation of the Softmatter core software.
This is meant to facilitate code sharing in the field by centralizing
and unifying basic functions.  The initial goals will be
infrastructure level code, but will hopefully grow to include analysis
code (ie tracking, g(r), etc).

Currently contains:

 - proprosed python API for serialization in python targeting 2.7
 - optimistic folder structure
